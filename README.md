### What is Netrum Lite Node CLI?
- Netrum Lite Node CLI is a lightweight command-line tool that allows anyone to participate in the Netrum decentralized compute network.

- It securely creates a wallet, connects to the Netrum server, registers the node on-chain, syncs uptime data, mines NPT tokens, and allows daily token claiming — all from your terminal.
