### What is Netrum Lite Node CLI?
- Netrum Lite Node CLI is a lightweight command-line tool that allows anyone to participate in the Netrum decentralized compute network.

- It securely creates a wallet, connects to the Netrum server, registers the node on-chain, syncs uptime data, mines NPT tokens, and allows daily token claiming ‚Äî all from your terminal.

- Ideal for VPS and low-resource devices, this node is designed for fast setup, full transparency, and passive token rewards.

### Hardware & Network Requirements
To run the Netrum Lite Node smoothly, make sure your system meets the following minimum requirements:

|----------|----------|----------|
| CPU | 2 Cores | 2+ Cores |
| RAM | 4 GB | 6 GB or more |
| Disk Space | 50 GB SSD | 100 GB SSD |

> SSD storage is highly recommended for faster performance and node stability.

### Network Requirements

  #### Copy my `requirements.js` for a smooth system requirements check
  ```
  curl -o /root/netrum-lite-node/src/system/system/requirements.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deeanalyst/netrum_litenode/main/requirements.js
  ```
  #### System Requirements Check
  ```
  netrum-system
  ```
  #### Create Wallet
  ```
  netrum-new-wallet
  ```
  After creating your wallet, fund it with $2 worth of `Base_ETH` and at least 0.001 `$Base_ETH Sepolia`.
  Import this wallet into your Metamask or Rabby Wallets, whichever you prefer.
  > Then visit [Base Names](https://www.base.org/names)
  	- Connect the wallet you created in previous command.
  	- Get a Base username. If the site doesn't show the name is available or it doesn't look like it is working, use a `VPN`, that's what worked for me.
  > Join Discord [Netrum Labs](https://discord.gg/uxDUgG9kW8)
  
  > Visit [Netrum Wait-list](https://netrumlabs.com/Waitlist?ref=0xc2d8a67d378c89C59E1EF857d93705390f4A6C07)
  	- Connect the same wallet you got the Base username on which is also your CLI Wallet.
  	- Complete the available tasks there to claim the `waitlist` role.
  #### Export the wallet keys
  If you are using a `VPS`, use this to copy the `key.txt` file to your Local machine `Downloads` folder. Paste the command in your `Command Prompt` and enter.
  ```
  scp root@<VPS_IP>:/root/netrum-lite-node/data/wallet/key.txt C:\Users\agoma\Downloads\
  ```
  Replace `<VPS_IP>` with your VPS IP, save the fingerprint and input your `VPS` password when prompted. It would then save to the folder.
  
  If you are using `WSL`, use this to copy the `key.txt` file to your Local machine `Downloads` folder Paste this command while still in `WSL` then enter.
  ```
  sudo cp /root/netrum-lite-node/data/wallet/key.txt /mnt/c/Users/xxx/Downloads/
  ```
  where `xxx` is your Local PC Username where you store your files.
  #### Check Basename conflicts
  ```
  netrum-check-basename
  ```
  #### Generate a Node ID
  ```
  netrum-node-id
  ```
  #### Sign a message with node key
  ```
  netrum-node-sign
  ```
  #### Register node on-chain
  ```
  netrum-node-register
  ```
  When you complete this step correctly, your `node-id` will be outputted.
  #### Sync blockchain data
  ```
  netrum-sync
  ```
  #### Start mining
  ```
  netrum-mining
  ```
  `NB:` You can only use the `netrum-claim` command after your node has mined `NHP` every 24 hours.
  #### Node mining logs
  ```
  netrum-mining-log
  ```
  `Ctrl A + D` to detach from screen.
  #### NHP Claim
  ```
  netrum-claim
  ```
### How to Get `LitenodeHunter` Role
- Go to the `‚Å†ü§ñ‚îÉbot-commands` channel in the Discord community.
- Type in `/register` it would drop down and show you the command for the `Netrum Node`.
- Paste your `node-id` in the dialog box and hit enter to bind your node to your Discord account.
`NB:` Your `node-id` looks like this `netrum.lite.deeanalyst.base.eth`

#### `NB`: Make sure you are in the netrum directory before running any `netrum` commands.
```
cd netrum-lite-node
```
